The Castleberry Classic was formed more than ten years ago to honor a deceased friend, fraternity brother, and schoolmate, Christopher Castleberry.

Christopher was a bright young man, a college graduate who served his country with honor in the reserves for four years, but sadly, like many others, he tragically lost his life due to substance abuse.
As anyone who has lost someone at too young an age knows, the loss rippled through family, fraternity brothers, school alumni, and friends.  Upon heartfelt reflection, a small group of former classmates decided to honor Christopher's memory, and in doing so to help create additional awareness for something so many Americans struggle with, often in private.

The Christopher Castleberry Memorial Foundation was founded in 2010 and has awarded scholarships to graduating seniors at Fountain Lake High School in Hot Springs, AR and Business majors at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, AR. Since its inception, the Christopher Castleberry foundation has distributed more than $21,500 in scholarships.

The Christopher Castleberry Memorial Foundation initiated an Edward Jones Endowment fund in 2016. The purpose of the endowment was to help make the Foundationâ€™s funds self-sustaining, and in turn, award scholarships for years to come, no matter the progress of its fundraising events..

We are gearing up for the 11th Annual Christopher Castleberry Game Day Classic! The Baggo tournament will be Saturday, September 4th, 2021, in North Little Rock, AR, at Diamond Bear Brewing Co.
Thanks to our sponsors and players, we had a record-breaking year last year and are looking forward to raising even more money this year for the Christopher Castleberry Memorial Foundation.
We would not be able to grow these scholarships if it weren't for our fantastic sponsors and their willingness to give. Thank you all so much, and we hope to see you on September 4th.
