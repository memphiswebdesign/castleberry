<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Christopher Castleberry Memorial Scholarship Essay</h4>

<div class="story-letter">
  <h6 style="margin-bottom:0;">By Ricky Calhoun</h6>
  <p>As a senior Business Administration major at Henderson State University, graduating in December 2025, my ultimate career goal is to become an entrepreneur. I’ve always been passionate about leading teams, streamlining operations, and creating positive workplace environments, and also with kids in middle school & high school. My long-term dream is to use my education, leadership experience, and passion for people to launch and grow businesses that give back to my community.</p>
  <p>Balancing school, work, leadership, and service has not been easy. I work 15 hours a week through work-study to help pay for school, and I have only one parent who can support me financially. Even with this help, each semester presents a financial hurdle that often causes stress and uncertainty about how I’ll make it through. Receiving this scholarship would significantly remove a burden and enable me to continue focusing on finishing strong and preparing for my career.</p>
  <p>I’ve been committed to leading and serving others throughout my time at Henderson. I currently serve as Vice President of AVOC, Public Relations in the Student Government Association, and the MTA Chairman/Keeper of Records of my chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. Through Kappa Alpha Psi, I’ve led initiatives such as distributing hundreds of backpacks during a back-to-school drive, packing over 300 food packages for the homeless, and volunteering at Peak Elementary by opening doors and reading to children. I’m also a member of the Black Student Association and Student Activities Board, where I collaborate on campus events that build unity and school spirit.</p>
  <p>Greek Life has shaped me into a leader who values brotherhood, service, and excellence. This scholarship would not only help me finish strong financially.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your consideration,<br>
  <strong>Ricky Calhoun</strong></p>
