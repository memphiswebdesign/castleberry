  <h6 style="margin-bottom:0;">Dear Castleberry Foundation,</h6>
  <p>I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for awarding me this scholarship. I was thrilled to learn of
  my selection for this honor and I am deeply appreciative of your support. The financial assistance you
  have provided me will be of great use towards my educational expenses and will allow me to concentrate
  more on my studies. With this scholarship I plan to continue my education with a newfound sense of
  passion towards my field of study. My selection for this scholarship has given me another reason to
  continue my degree with an effort to not only graduate but to succeed highly in my chosen field. Your
  generosity has inspired me to help and give back to the community. Being able to earn my degree with
  your generous help reminds me of the financial aid that I may hopefully be able to give to others in the
  future. As a Business major with future aspirations of becoming a successful leader, I don't know what I
  want to become yet, but I am open to exploring different paths where I can use my skills, whether in
  entrepreneurship, management, or consulting, to make a meaningful impact. This scholarship significantly
  reduces the financial burden of my education. Your support not only contributes to my academic expenses
  but also invests in my future career , where I aim to uphold the standards of excellence and integrity in the
  business industry. Thank you again for the support that you have given to me and the confidence in my
  success that this scholarship instills.</p>
  <p>Thank you,<br>
