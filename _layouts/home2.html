              <p class="ft-20">Christopher was a bright young man, a college graduate who served his country with honor in the reserves for four years, but sadly, like many others, he tragically lost his life due to substance abuse.</p>

        <p>As anyone who has lost someone at too young an age knows, the loss rippled through family, fraternity brothers, school alumni, and friends. Upon heartfelt reflection, a small group of former classmates decided to honor Christopher's memory, and in doing so to help create additional awareness for something so many Americans struggle with, often in private.</p>
        <p>The Christopher Castleberry Memorial Foundation's mission is to award an annual scholarship to a senior at Fountain Lake High School and a business student at Henderson in honor of a great friend. Our goal is to grow our Raymond James Investment Fund large enough to generate an endless flow of scholarships.</p>
        <p>The Raymond James Endowment Funds was started in 2016 and has since distributed more than <strong><a href="/recipients">$35k worth of scholarships.</a></strong></p>
        <p>We are gearing up for this year's annual Castleberry Classic; for more information, please visit <a href="https://birdease.com/castleberryclassic">CastleberryClassic.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Thanks to our sponsors and players, we had a record-breaking year last year, and we look forward to raising even more funds this year for the Christopher Castleberry Memorial Foundation scholarship recipients.</p>
        <p>We could not grow these scholarships without our fantastic sponsors and their generosity. Thank you all so much, and we hope to see you there.</p>
